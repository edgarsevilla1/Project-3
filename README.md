## Project #3

- <b>Description:</b>  A complete "Web Dev Story" that adopts a Design Thinking approach to address a problem through a front-end website build

- This project has a story behind it, with the intent to bring your mechanical issues over to a trusted source to be evaluated, issue guidance & tutorials for DIY projects, and recommendations provided by an experienced certified mechanical technician. This idea came to light after interviewing several students at Kean University, raising the question, "What is something you would like to see from a website that will fix a modern solution we didn't know we needed." The idea of going to a website that provides dozens of ideas, solutions, and video tutorials to fix a car would be nice to see. Thus, AutoDIYGuide came to fruition.
