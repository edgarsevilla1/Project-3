## Project #1

- <b>Description:</b>  My personal website portfolio about me.

- This project and the following projects will portray my technical skills & knowledge of web development using a mixture of HTML, CSS, & Javascript. This project intends to introduce the viewer to my front-end web development skills, attributes, and years of experience in respected fields within the industry.

## Project #2

- <b>Description:</b>  A front-end prototype of an E-commerce website

- Welcome to my prototype E-commerce website. Here you will find a video game store E-commerce website idea I pitched to a potential client. I used a series of web development elements to bring this website to life using a mixture of HTML, CSS, & Javascript. I hope you enjoy the prototype and become a future client of this store !

## Project #3

- <b>Description:</b>  A complete "Web Dev Story" that adopts a Design Thinking approach to address a problem through a front-end website build

- This project has a story behind it, with the intent to bring your mechanical issues over to a trusted source to be evaluated, issue guidance & tutorials for DIY projects, and recommendations provided by an experienced certified mechanical technician. This idea came to light after interviewing several students at Kean University, raising the question, "What is something you would like to see from a website that will fix a modern solution we didn't know we needed." The idea of going to a website that provides dozens of ideas, solutions, and video tutorials to fix a car would be nice to see. Thus, AutoDIYGuide came to fruition.
